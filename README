Simple script that allows you to easily tab a section of spaces to a desired
column; I.e. if you want all your comments to line up on virt col 41 try
":FeralAlign 41" when your cursor is in a position to "ciw"; I.e. saves you
from "ciw<tab><tab><tab>"etc. But that is about all this does (=

Works with single lines or ranges. Ranges must be specified by a single column,
block-wise visual selection; (i.e. "<ctrl-v>j"). So to align 5 lines, place
your cursor in a good spot (where a "ciw" wont keel something important; i.e.
spaces before the comment chars) and "<ctrl-v>4j:FeralAlign 41"; easy as that.

Limitation: Aligns to the nearest tabstop.

This script is possibly of academic value as a way to get a range command to
preserve the cursors column.
